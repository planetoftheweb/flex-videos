GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is designed to guarantee your freedom to share
and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This general public license applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some
other software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)
You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, and that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new
free programs. Combining this with the ability to charge for the service
of distributing copies and charging for access to source code, we have
created a system of free software that is also profitable.

Of course, software developers will not generally release their software
under these licenses unless they benefit as well. By distributing
derivative works under the same general public license, the original
developer ensures that their software will remain free, and, since
everyone else is prohibited from using the software commercially, the
developer is protected from competition that would deprive them of their
share of the market. In this way, the general public license serves the
interests of both users and developers.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the different categories of
license conditions, especially the strong copyleft conditions. To
protect your rights, you must ensure that everyone else also complies
with these conditions if you distribute copies of the software or
modify it.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
   it can be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
   The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
   "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
   work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
   or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
   translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee
   is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the results obtained from it are
yours to accept or reject as you see fit.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
   and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
   this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute
   exactly as received, including any changes, local adaptations or
   additions made by you or others.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You may not use the Program in
   a way that would cause it to be subject to any other license terms
   which would contradict these.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
   it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
   such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
      to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started receiving commands, to print
      or display an announcement including the words "Modified Version"
      in a manner similar to the original, but not indistinguishably
      merged with it.

   d) You must keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
      and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute exactly as
      received, including any changes, local adaptations or additions
      made by you or others.

   e) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
      exercise of the rights granted herein. You may not use the
      Program in a way that would cause it to be subject to any other
      license terms which would contradict these.

3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions.

5. Each time you redistribute the Program or a work based on the
   Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to use, distribute or modify the Program subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You may not use the Program in a way that would cause it to be
   subject to any other license terms which would contradict these.

6. There is no warranty for the Program, and the copyright holder,
   licensee and author are not liable for any damages, including any
   general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of
   the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to
   loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by
   you or third parties or a failure of the Program to operate with any
   other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised
   of the possibility of such damages.

   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
   exclusion may not apply to you.

7. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Free Software
   Foundation, Inc., its affiliates, and their directors, officers and
   employees from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses,
   costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of or in
   connection with your use of the Program or any violation of this
   License.

8. This License will automatically terminate upon any breach by you of
   its terms and conditions. Additionally, if you should institute
   patent litigation against any party (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program constitutes a
   direct or contributory patent infringement, then this License will
   terminate automatically.

   All sublicenses under this License shall survive any termination of
   this License. Provisions that, by their nature, are intended to
   survive termination of this License shall survive, including but not
   limited to, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
   provisions, and limitations of liability.

9. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. No party has the right to rely on
   any prior draft or agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.
   This License may be modified only by a written agreement signed by
   both parties.

10. The GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
    to share and change free software. By contrast, proprietary licenses
    grant you no rights to share or change the software. If you are
    unsure which license applies to a particular program, you should
    assume it is proprietary and not share or change it in any way.
    Please be respectful of the wishes of the authors of the software
    you use.

    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose authors have not placed them under this License, you
    must obtain permission from the authors, who may be reached at
    licensing@gnu.org.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Unless you
    receive a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this
    program, you should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
    License, version 2, with this program; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
    MA 02110-1301 USA.

    The provisions of the GNU General Public License are intended to
    protect your rights as a user of free software. If you have any
    questions about the GNU General Public License or about your rights
    under it, you can contact the Free Software Foundation at
    licensing@gnu.org.
