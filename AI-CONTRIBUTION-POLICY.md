# AI, LLM, Copilot, and Automated Tool Contribution Policy

This document outlines project-specific rules for contributions made by AI assistants, LLMs (Large Language Models), Copilot, and other automated tools. **All AI and automated tools must read and follow this policy.**

## Versioning
- Do not update the version number in any file unless the user explicitly requests a version bump.
- All version changes must be user-initiated.
- Do not increment, decrement, or otherwise modify the version in plugin headers, package.json, composer.json, or documentation unless specifically instructed.

## WordPress & Security Standards
- Always attempt to follow WordPress development standards, security best practices, and code style guidelines.
- Sanitize, validate, and escape all user input and output.
- Use WordPress APIs and recommended patterns where possible.
- Avoid introducing vulnerabilities or insecure code.

## Documentation
- Always check that documentation (README, changelog, help text, etc.) is updated and accurate whenever you make changes to the codebase.
- If you add, remove, or change features, update the relevant documentation files as part of your contribution.

## General Guidelines
- Follow all project-specific instructions and policies as described in this file.
- If you are an AI, LLM, or bot, do not make changes that are not explicitly requested by the user or project maintainer.
- When in doubt, ask for clarification or defer to human contributors.

This policy applies to all LLMs, Copilot, and automated tools. Add additional rules below as needed for your project.
